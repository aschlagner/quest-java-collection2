SEA8 - Quest: Collection 02: Comparable and Comparator

Challenge: Endgame

With the population of heroes being successfully reduced by half, Thanos has achieved everything he set out to do. He is now left wondering what he should do now.

He is torn between retiring as a farmer and hunting down and identifying heroes in order to compile statistics.

After much deliberation, Thanos settled on the second option: and he starts programming his infinity glove to perform the following sorting actions.

To start, Fork the following repository then clone it locally.

    Make sure you Fork properly, otherwise you won't be able to push anything!

    Modify the Hero class by using the Comparable class. The default sort order should be alphabetically by the name attribute.

    In the Thanos class, ensure that the list of heroes is sorted alphabetically.

    In the Thanos class, add a Comparator to sort the list of heroes by the age attribute in descending order.
